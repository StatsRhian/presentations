## Hundreds of courses a year

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/r-lecture.jpg")
```

???
* We deliver over 100 R, Python and Stan training courses each year
* Engaging with thousands of new learners.

## Moving training online

--

### `r fa(name = "virus", fill = "white")` &nbsp; So March 2020 happened

--

### `r fa(name = "user-friends", fill = "white")` &nbsp; We tested online training internally

--

### `r fa(name = "tired", fill = "white")` &nbsp;  It was DULL

???

The necessity to move to fully online training in March last year meant we quickly had to completely rethink how to deliver R training interactively online. We internally trialled running our usual in-person training just on Zoom - and it really doesn’t work trust us!

name: r-materials

## Starting point: R Materials

.pull-left[
- Already using {rmarkdown} {tufte} notes, {xaringan} slides
- On GitLab with many CI checks
- Course packages to handle dependencies e.g. {jrIntroduction}

- Even our Python course are built with R infrastructure
- We just count chapters from 0 instead...

name: new-workflow

## New Workflow
However, our new workflow uses R in every step of the way, from creating a bespoke learning environment, to collating feedback and generating certificates.

This improves the learning experience as the “small” things are automated and allows the trainer to concentrate on actual training.

---

Upcoming training sessions are stored in Asana. Using a single call from R, we extract the relevant Asana task details and:

* Provide the client with a single URL that contains all necessary information for the course

* Deploy a bespoke virtual training environment with {analogsea}

* Automate password generation with {shiny}

* Track and upload attendance sheets

* Create bespoke Google Documents for code quizzes

* Generate fill-in-the-blank tutor R scripts

* Provide automatic feedback reports for clients with {rmarkdown}, {shiny} & {rtypeform}

* Deliver personalised certificates in {shiny}

* Tag the training materials and VM to enable a completely reproducible set-up

Add presenter notes here

---
* Code review: the balance between being reviewed and wasting senior people's time with reviewing a missing full spot 
* But we want to encourage missing tiny little bugs, so need minimial barriers.
* Challenges as the team grows. Saying "look in the Dockerfile" is not a good solution
* Moving from master -> main. I've not really seen this being talked about other than "I've moved my toy repo". With us, we had to block off a day for two people.
* Talk about Rmd and keeping track of dangling branches
* Balance between having the package in the repo vs a separate repo
* Using renv isn't a solution for notes
* Every repo should have a readme. No-one botherered, so we now autogenerate
* Every repo should have a project description. No one bothered, so we now (well we will soon) autogenerate to point to our website
