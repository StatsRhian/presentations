# Continuous integration?


Are you forgetful and lazy like me, but still want to make fabulous, dependable R packages? Enter Travis, a helpful service which can automatically run checks, tests and even tweet about your package. I'll explain what continuous integration is and tell stories of how we use it at Jumping Rivers. I'll also introduce inteRgrate, an R package we've developed to help us keep our packages running smoothly.

* What is it?
* Why we should use it?
* How do you use it?
* How we use it a Jumping Rivers?
* Introducting inteRgrate.
* Mention [tic](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic)

# inteRgrate `r emo::ji("package")`

* We wanted to simplfy and standardise the way we use CI at Jumping Rivers
* Cross platform * work with both
* make continuous integration more consistent across platforms
* While checking R packages on travis is easy, support for GitLab (and others) is lacking.
* When developing a package, sometimes we want to specify the exact number of NOTES and WARNINGS we expect/allow.
* Having a consistent system for different CI is desirable.
* For our CI steps, we have a few other checks that we tend to implement, e.g. lints, not using imports within namespaces.

# Main functions

  * `check_pkg()`
  * `check_r_filenames()`
  * `check_tidy_description()`
  * `check_lintr()`
  * `check_namespace()`
  

check_pkg() - installs package dependencies, builds & installs the package, before running package check. By default, any notes or warnings will raise an error message. This can be changed by setting the environment variables ALLOWED_NOTES and ALLOWED_WARNINGS.

check_namespace() - check for instances of import() in the NAMESPACE file. By default, no imports are allowed. This can be changed via the environment variable NO_IMPORTS

check_lintr() - runs lintr on the package, README.Rmd and vignettes.

check_r_filenames() - ensures file extensions are .R and all names are lower case.
check_tidy_description() - ensure that the DESCRIPTION file is tidy, via usethis::use_tidy_description().

# Summary 

* Do use continous integration
* Don't get upset/angry when it fails
* Do feel happy that you've taken a step toward more robust code
* We can help you with CI set up and more.
